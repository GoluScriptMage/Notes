# 🚀 TypeScript Speed Run: Pro Edition

> **"From Zero to Hero in 3 Days + Bonus"**  
> Master the advanced TypeScript patterns used in top-tier codebases

---

## 🎯 What is This?

This is NOT your typical TypeScript tutorial. We're skipping the boring primitives (`string`, `number`, `boolean`) and diving straight into the **professional patterns** that make libraries like React, Redux, and Socket.io so powerful.

Think of it as a **boss rush mode** for TypeScript learning. 🎮
